 * Based on xm2esf - https://github.com/oerg866/xm2esf
 * Â© 2010-2015 Eric Voirin alias Oerg866
 * 
 * xm2esf is released under a license similar to the MIT License but with restrictions on commercial use.
 * In the extraordinarily unlikely chance someone wants to use this conversion in a commercial project... have fun figuring that out.
 * 
 * Initial FreeBASIC -> Java conversion was done using Google Gemini.
 * I wonder if that also makes commercial use interesting from a license standpoint?
 * A non-trivial effort was required to make the resulting code actually work and be structured like a Java program.
 * I'm not positive if Gemini saved any time vs converting manually or building from scratch based on the ESF documentation.
 * Gemini initially thought the FreeBASIC code was trying to parse .xml if that's an indicator of how well it works.
 * It was good at explaining how math functions differ between FreeBASIC and Java at least.
 * 
 * This was all done to avoid writing a sound driver, which I will probably eventually do anyway.
